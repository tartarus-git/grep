TODO LIST:

	- Comment the define in Visual Studio, make sure the new code you added in the last commit looks good there.
	- Test if the dynamic buffer scales properly when exposed to large and to small test files.
	- Make sure that the sleep_for code doesn't get hit when your piping input. It already shouldn't, just test it using a little bit of piping.
