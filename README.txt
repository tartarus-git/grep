Just wanted to say this from the get-go: Regex parsing isn't done in here. We use the regex header provided by the C++ standard library to do that.
I'm aware that this makes the program a whole lot simpler and a lot of the challenge dissappears, but I wanted to do it like this because I didn't want to first familiarize myself
with regex in order to build a parser. Maybe I'll do that at a later time.
